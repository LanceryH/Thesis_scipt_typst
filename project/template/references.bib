	abstract = {The acquisition of new global elevation data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter, carried on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, permits quantification of the surface roughness properties of the Moon at unprecedented scales and resolution. We map lunar surface roughness using a range of parameters: median absolute slope, both directional (along-track) and bidirectional (in two dimensions); median differential slope; and Hurst exponent, over baselines ranging from ∼17 m to ∼2.7 km. We find that the lunar highlands and the mare plains show vastly different roughness properties, with subtler variations within mare and highlands. Most of the surface exhibits fractal-like behavior, with a single or two different Hurst exponents over the given baseline range; when a transition exists, it typically occurs near the 1 km baseline, indicating a significant characteristic spatial scale for competing surface processes. The Hurst exponent is high within the lunar highlands, with a median value of 0.95, and lower in the maria (with a median value of 0.76). The median differential slope is a powerful tool for discriminating between roughness units and is useful in characterizing, among other things, the ejecta surrounding large basins, particularly Orientale, as well as the ray systems surrounding young, Copernican-age craters. In addition, it allows a quantitative exploration on mare surfaces of the evolution of surface roughness with age.},

	abstract = {Topography is the expression of both internal and external processes of a planetary body. Thus hypsometry (the study of topography) is a way to decipher the dynamics of a planet. For that purpose, the statistics of height and slopes may be described by different tools, at local and global scale. We propose here to use the multifractalapproach to describe fields of topography. This theory encompasses height and slopes and other statistical moments of the field, taking into account the scale invariance. Contrary to the widely used fractalformalism, multifractals are able to describe the intermittency of the topography field. As we commonly observe a juxtaposition of rough and smooth topographies at a given scale, the multifractal framework seems to be appropriate for hypsometric studies. Here we analyze the data at global scale of the Earth, Mars, Mercury and the Moon and find that the statistics are in good agreement with the multifractaltheory for scale larger than  ∼ 10 km. Surprisingly, the analysis shows that all bodies have the same fractal behavior for scale smaller than  ∼ 10 km. We hypothesize that dynamic topography of the mantle may be the explanation at large scale, whereas the smaller scale behavior may be related to elastic thickness.},

We conduct exhaustive one-dimensional (both longitudinal and latitudinal) and two-dimensional studies based on Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data using the multifractal formalism called Wavelet Leaders Method (WLM). This approach shows that a scale break occurs at approximately 15km, giving two scaling regimes in both 1D and 2D cases. At small scales, these topographic profiles mostly display a monofractal behavior while a switch to multifractality is observed in several areas at larger scales. The scaling exponents extracted from this framework tend to be greater at small scales. In the 1D context, these observations are in agreement with previous works and thus suggest that the WLM is well-suited for examining scaling properties of topographic fields. Moreover, the 2D analysis is the first such complete study to our knowledge. It gives both a local and global insight on the scaling regimes of the surface of Mars and allows to exhibit the link between the scaling exponents and several famous features of the Martian topography. These results may be used as a solid basis for further investigations of the scaling laws of the Red planet and show that the WLM could be used to perform systematic analyses of the surface roughness of other celestial bodies.},

Using new stochastic modeling and data analysis techniques, this book provides an overview of the nonclassical, multifractal statistics. By generalizing the classical turbulence laws, emergent higher-level laws of atmospheric dynamics are obtained and are empirically validated over time-scales of seconds to decades and length-scales of millimetres to the size of the planet. In generalizing the notion of scale, atmospheric complexity is reduced to a manageable scale-invariant hierarchy of processes, thus providing a new perspective for modeling and understanding the atmosphere. This synthesis of state-of-the-art data and nonlinear dynamics is systematically compared with other analyses and global circulation model outputs. This is an important resource for atmospheric science researchers new to multifractal theory and is also valuable for graduate students in atmospheric dynamics and physics, meteorology, oceanography and climatology.},

	abstract = {Surface roughness is a statistical measure of change in surface height over a given spatial horizontal scale after the effect of broad-scale slope has been removed and can be used to understand how geologic processes produce and modify a planet's topographic character at different scales. The statistical measure of surface roughness employed in this study of Mercury was the root-mean-square deviation and was calculated from 45 to 90°N at horizontal baselines of 0.5–250 km with detrended topographic data from individual Mercury Laser Altimeter tracks. As seen in previous studies, the surface roughness of Mercury has a bimodal spatial distribution, with the cratered terrain (dominated by the intercrater plains) possessing higher-surface roughness than the smooth plains. The measured surface roughness for both geologic units is controlled by a trade-off between impact craters generating higher-surface roughness values and flood-mode volcanism decreasing surface roughness. The topography of the two terrain types has self-affine-like behavior at baselines from 0.5 to 1.5 km; the smooth plains collectively have a Hurst exponent of 0.88 ± 0.01, whereas the cratered terrains have a Hurst exponent of 0.95 ± 0.01. Subtle variations in the surface roughness of the smooth plains can be attributed to differences in regional differences in the spatial density of tectonic landforms. The northern rise, a 1000 km wide region of elevated topography centered at 65°N, 40°E, is not distinguishable in surface roughness measurements over baselines of 0.5–250 km.},

These log-cumulants theoretically enable discrimination between mono- and multifractal processes, as well as between simple log-normal multifractal models and more advanced ones. The goal of the present contribution is to design nonparametric bootstrap hypothesis tests aiming at testing the nature of the multifractal properties of stochastic processes and empirical data. Bootstrap issues together with six declinations of test designs are analyzed. Their statistical performance (significances, powers, and p-values) are assessed and compared by means of Monte Carlo simulations performed on synthetic stochastic processes whose multifractal properties (and log-cumulants) are known theoretically a priori. We demonstrate that the joint use of wavelet Leaders, log-cumulants, and bootstrap procedures enable us to obtain a powerful tool for testing the multifractal properties of data. This tool is practically effective and can be applied to a single observation of data with finite length.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric ice crystals scatter sunlight, affecting Earth’s climate through the radiation properties of cirrus clouds. Naturally occurring surface roughness and its effect on the scattering properties of ice crystals remain largely unknown. Scattering by ice crystals with rough surfaces is studied by placing a finite, thin surface-roughness element on an infinitely large, planar vacuum-ice boundary. The elements are generated using a statistical model based on fractional Brownian motion. The horizontal roughness scale is described by the Hurst exponent H and the vertical roughness scale with the root-mean-square roughness parameter Rq. The computations are performed with the surface mode of the Discrete Dipole Approximation software ADDA (version 1.34b). Several incident directions for wavelength of 0.5 µm from both above and below the planar surface are studied. A refractive index for ice m=1.313+i5.889×10−10 is used throughout the computations. Results are averaged over ten rough surface realizations for a specific H, Rq-pair. Scattering by the rough elements is compared to that by the corresponding smooth elements. The rougher the element is, the more of the scattered intensity is transmitted through the surface. The rough elements have distinctively smoother angular distributions for the degree of linear polarization than their smooth counterparts. Also, it is found that while roughness itself affects polarization, the exact surface morphology does not seem to have a significant effect. The vertical roughness scale Rq has a larger effect on the light scattering results than the horizontal scale H. Enhanced angular scattering is detected in directions nearly parallel to the vacuum-ice boundary within the ice medium. The phenomenon is explained with a strong internal reflection mechanism. The model for surface roughness, along with the light scattering methodology used here, could be incorporated into geometric optics ray-tracing computations for large ice crystals and other particles.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an alternative to Hapke’s correction for the photometric effect of macroscopic roughness of planetary surfaces (Hapke, 1984). Our model includes the effects of both single-facet scattering and multi-facet scattering. The single-facet scattering model is derived directly from the definition of bidirectional reflectance of a rough surface. We model projected shadowing by adopting an approximation published elsewhere in the literature. Monte Carlo simulations of single-facet scattering demonstrate very good agreement with the single-facet scattering component of our model. Using 3D printed molds with known roughness statistics, we prepared rough mineral surfaces consisting of quartz and olivine in the laboratory. We recorded extensive measurements of the rough surface bidirectional reflectance over a wide range of illumination and view geometries at 1751 wavelength bands ranging from 500–2250 nm. By fitting the residual between the measured bidirectional reflectance and our single-facet scattering model, we developed an empirical approximation for multi-facet scattering. Our results show that the multi-facet scattering is proportional to the surface’s diffusive reflectance, RMS slope, and the cosine of the illumination angle. Furthermore, the multi-facet scattering is approximately Lambertian for phase angles less than 90° but becomes forward scattering at higher phase angles. Our empirical multi-facet scattering model incorporates all of these features. As a surface becomes more macroscopically rough, our data show that the overall reflectance distribution becomes progressively more backscattering in a way that is distinct from the shadow hiding opposition effect. We refer to this effect as the macroscopic roughness backscattering bias (MRBB), which affects the entire hemisphere rather than being localized to small phase angles. Our proposed model is more accurate than Hapke’s for phase angles less than 90°, and the accuracy of the two models is comparable at higher phase angles. However, researchers should be aware of an issue regarding the roughness parameter defined in Hapke’s model, namely the fact that “ϑ¯” is not actually equal to the mean slope angle of the surface for the probability density function used in the model. This is an issue which apparently has gone unnoticed in the literature, and has potentially caused the model to be applied incorrectly in past studies.},

The resulting curves are discussed in terms of the geological processes that shape the surfaces of terrestrial planets. We concentrate in particular on the Median Differential Slope (MDS), a measure of roughness that has already proven its relevance for the analysis of Martian and Lunar topography. The comparison of the MDS vs. baseline curves for different types of terrains on each planet reveals interesting common trends as well as intriguing differences. The Lunar highlands display the highest values of MDS at baselines larger than 2km but Mercury highlands seem to be slightly rougher at shorter baselines. Mars southern plateaus appear much smoother at all scales. On each planet, younger terrains show lower roughness than old terrains at long baselines. However, because they display a strong negative slope of MDS vs. baseline, the contrast of roughness between young and old terrains is fainter at short baseline.},

	abstract = {Studies of the roughness of natural surfaces (landscapes) provide useful information for planetary geology. This paper covers the mapping and analysis of the spatial variability of the surface roughness of Martian topography at a high spatial resolution (metre-scale). The methodology provides new images of the Martian surface texture at the metre-scale that can assist in the interpretation of geological events, processes and formations. It can also assist in geological mapping and in the evaluation of sites that merit further exploration. Digital elevation models, generated by stereo-pair HiRISE images, of six different terrains (aeolian, volcanic, hydrated, cratered, reticulate and sublimated) were used to characterize the metre-scale terrain roughness of representative test sites on Mars. Surface roughness was evaluated by using the local fractal dimension and the results show that the mean of the local fractal dimension ranges from 2.17 in reticulate terrain to 2.71 in sublimated terrain in the southern polar cap. The roughness of the sublimated terrain is significantly higher than the roughness of typical terrains on Earth. Basically, the roughness of the Martian terrain at the metre-scale depends on the rugosity of the landscape, which can be quantified as the number of metric-scale closed depressions and mounds present on the terrain. The information provided by the spatial variability patterns of metre-scale roughness maps provides a significant resource for local planetary geology research at high resolution scale.},

	abstract = {We used Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) data from the current Mars Global Surveyor mission to characterize the topographic roughness of the Martian surface and to provide a mean to evaluate clutter at long (10–300 m) wavelengths. Such wavelengths are relevant for the MARSIS and SHARAD subsurface radars, which will be flown in future missions to Mars. The method of analysis is based on the assumption that topography can be described as a self-affine fractal: 30-km-long segments of MOLA altimetry profiles have thus been reduced to the topographic parameters RMS height, RMS slope, and Hurst exponent, this last related to the fractal dimension, which can be used as inputs to a near-nadir radar scattering model. The values of the Hurst exponent are greater than 0.5 for most of the surface, meaning a scaling behavior which is almost self-similar. Maps of RMS height and Hurst exponent show that these two parameters have very different spatial distributions: whereas the RMS height is patterned after the north-south dichotomy, the Hurst exponent follows a latitudinal trend. We make use of a multivariate method called G-mode to classify profiles in the three-dimensional parameter space: we find several roughness units, some of which have a strong correlation with certain geologic units, while others are bound by latitude. However, at scales between 300 m and 3 km, large stretches of the surface of Mars share common statistical properties of topography, independent from the north-south dichotomy.},

	abstract = {In the present study, we investigate the scaling properties of the topography of Mars. Planetary topographic fields are well known to roughly exhibit (mono)fractal behavior. Indeed, the fractal formalism reproduces much of the variability observed in topography. Still, a single fractal dimension is not enough to explain the huge variability and intermittency. Previous studies have claimed that fractal dimensions might be different from one region to another, excluding a general description at the planetary scale. In this article, we analyze the Martian topographic data with a multifractal formalism to study the scaling intermittency. In the multifractal paradigm, the apparent local variation of the fractal dimension is interpreted as a statistical property of multifractal fields. We analyze the topography measured with the Mars Orbiter Laser altimeter (MOLA) at 300 m horizontal resolution, 1 m vertical resolution. We adapted the Haar fluctuation method to the irregularly sampled signal. The results suggest a multifractal behavior from the planetary scale down to 10 km. From 10 to 300 m, the topography seems to be simple monofractal. This transition indicates a significant change in the geological processes governing the Red Planet's surface.},

Also topography is critical for evaluating surface habitability. We propose here a general statistical theory to describe and generate realistic synthetic topographies of rocky exoplanetary bodies. In the Solar system, we have examined the best-known bodies: the Earth, Moon, Mars, and Mercury. It turns out that despite their differences, they all can be described by multifractral statistics, although with different parameters. Assuming that this property is universal, we propose here a model to simulate 2D spherical random field that mimics a rocky planetary body in a stellar system. We also propose to apply this model to estimate the statistics of oceans and continents to help to better assess the habitability of distant worlds.},

This has lead to the development of many techniques for decomposing series and fields into fluctuations \&Delta;v at well-defined scales. Classically, one defines fluctuations as differences: (\&Delta;vdiff = v(x+\&Delta;x)-v(x) and this is adequate for many applications (\&Delta;x is the "lag"). However, if over a range one has scaling \&Delta;v \&propto; \&Delta;xH, these difference fluctuations are only adequate when 0 H H H vHaar at lag \&Delta;x is simply equal to the difference of the mean from x to x+ \&Delta;x/2 and from x+\&Delta;x/2 to x+\&Delta;x. Indeed, we shall see that the interest of the Haar wavelet is this relation to the integrated process rather than its wavelet nature per se. 

 Using numerical multifractal simulations, we show that it is quite accurate, and we compare and contrast it with another similar technique, detrended fluctuation analysis. We find that, for estimating scaling exponents, the two methods are very similar, yet Haar-based methods have the advantage of being numerically faster, theoretically simpler and physically easier to interpret.},

We introduce the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis with Polynomial and Trigonometric functions (MFDFAPT) method via optimal model selection from an optimization framework. The performance of MFDFAPT is assessed with extensive numerical experiments based on the multifractal binomial cascade process, fractional Brownian movements, and fractional Gaussian noises. MFDFAPT shows better performance than MFDFA in the approximation of the Hurst index, and correctly determines the scalar behavior in stationary and non-stationary series. Additionally we apply MFDFAPT to detect and characterize the scalar properties of the daily precipitation time series in meteorological stations of Tabasco, México. Our results confirm previous indications that the general Hurst exponent depends on the physiographic characteristics of the study area, and that fractal dimension correctly characterizes the series of daily precipitations in tropical regions.},

The article first conducts segmentation experiments under various conditions, including different target shapes, image backgrounds, and resolutions, to verify the feasibility of MF-AC-DFA. It then compares the proposed method with gradient segmentation methods and demonstrates the superiority of MF-AC-DFA. Finally, real-life wire diagrams and transmission tower diagrams are used for segmentation, which shows the application potential of MF-AC-DFA in complex scenes.

	abstract = {Uncertain systems are those wherein some variability is observed, meaning that different observations of the system will produce different measurements. Studying such systems demands the use of statistical methods over multiple measurements, which allows overcoming the uncertainty, based on the premise that a single measurement is not representative of the system’s behavior. In such cases, the current multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) method cannot offer confident conclusions. This work presents multi-signal MFDFA (MS-MFDFA), a novel methodology for accurately characterizing uncertain systems using the MFDFA algorithm, which enables overcoming the uncertainty of the system by simultaneously considering a large set of signals. As a case study, we consider the problem of characterizing software (Sw) consumption. The difficulty of the problem mainly comes from the complexity of the interactions between Sw and hardware (Hw), as well as from the high uncertainty level of the consumption measurements, which are affected by concurrent Sw services, the Hw, and external factors such as ambient temperature. We apply MS-MFDFA to generate a signature of the Sw consumption profile, regardless of the execution time, the consumption levels, and uncertainty. Multiple consumption signals (or time series) are built from different Sw runs, obtaining a high frequency sampling of the instant input current for each of them while running the Sw. A benchmark of eight Sw programs for analysis is also proposed. Moreover, a fully functional application to automatically perform MS-MFDFA analysis has been made freely available. The results showed that the proposed methodology is a suitable approximation for the multifractal analysis of a large number of time series obtained from uncertain systems. Moreover, analysis of the multifractal properties showed that this approach was able to differentiate between the eight Sw programs studied, showing differences in the temporal scaling range where multifractal behavior is found.},

This approach has been used extensively to characterize surface complexity in terms of rugosity or roughness. In this paper, the local fractal dimension is proposed as a means of mapping the spatial variability of the surface roughness of the Martian landscape. The local fractal dimension complements measures of topographic roughness proposed by other authors and provides new images of the Martian surface texture at the kilometric scale that can be used to interpret geological events, geological processes and geological formations. It can also assist in geological mapping and in the detection and prioritisation of sites that merit further exploration. Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter data were used to characterize the kilometre-scale terrain roughness of Mars. The procedure is general and can also be applied to digital elevation models with higher resolution (for example, digital elevation models generated by stereo-pair HiRISE images) to assess roughness at the metric scale. Sixteen test sites were selected and used to illustrate the patterns of the spatial variability of landscape roughness (local fractal dimension maps) at the kilometric scale. The results show that the mean of the local fractal dimension ranges from 2.036 in Argyre Planitia to 2.403 at the North Pole. The results also show that the mean roughness values of the Martian landscapes are less than those of the Earth's continents. Basically, the roughness of the Martian terrain at the kilometric scale depends, inter alia, on the number of kilometric-scale landforms present on the terrain. It is thus logical that the local fractal dimension is higher on Earth, a geologically active planet, than on Mars. Only the North Pole test site (an area larger than the North polar ice cap) shows a roughness histogram similar to those of terrestrial sites. The abundance of information embedded in the spatial variability patterns in the roughness maps provides a significant resource for planetary geology research.},

We found that Aeolis Planum, the flanks of Tharsis Montes, and the chaos terrain south of Olympus Mons are particularly rich in Europan roughness analogues.

	abstract = {We assess the surface roughness of Europa by reevaluating Galileo stereo images. Roughness provides important information about surface textures, which are related to geologic processes operating at a variety of scales. Roughness also sets important performance requirements for various remote sensing instruments on board the upcoming icy satellite missions to the Jovian System. In this study, roughness is derived for different geologic terrains on Europa, which have been distinguished through geomorphological mapping. For each terrain type we derive the scale dependent root-mean-square roughness and corresponding Hurst exponents. We investigate the scale between 30 m and 5 km and show that Europa’s surface can mostly be described by a monofractal behavior over these baselines (i.e., surface roughness follows power laws with breakpoints located at a few hundred meters). Hurst exponents are higher below the breakpoints with typical values between 0.4 and 0.8 and lower above, typically between 0.2 and 0.6. This behavior is mostly controlled by ridges which are dominating the topography on Europa. At unity scale (1 m) roughness is extrapolated to be around 0.4–0.7 m with strong exceptions on chaos terrain where values over 1–2 m can be achieved, assuming that no further breakpoints are present below the resolution of the digital terrain models used in this study.},

Our argument is divided in two parts. We ﬁrst survey the main topographic models and show that they are based on convolutions of basic structures (singularities) with noises. Focusing on models with large numbers of degrees of freedom (fractional Brownian motion (fBm), fractional Levy motion (fLm), multifractal fractionally integrated ﬂux (FIF) model), we show that they are distinguished by the type of underlying noise. In addition, realistic models require anisotropic singularities; we show how to generalize the basic isotropic (self-similar) models to anisotropic ones. Using numerical simulations, we display the subtle interplay between statistics, singularity structure and resulting topographic morphology. We show how the existence of anisotropic singularities with highly variable statistics can lead to unwarranted conclusions about scale breaking.},

We studied 20 areas scattered across the surface of Europa and estimated their photometric behavior using the Hapke radiative transfer model and a Bayesian framework in order to estimate their microphysical state. We have found that most of them were consistent with the bright backscattering behavior of Europa, already observed at a global scale, indicating the presence of grains maturated by space weathering. However, we have identified very bright areas showing a narrow forward scattering possibly indicating the presence of fresh deposits that could be attributed to recent cryovolcanism or jets. Overall, we showed that the photometry of Europa’s surface is more diverse than previously thought and so is its microphysical state.},

	abstract = {Time-correlated noise is a signiﬁcant source of uncertainty when modeling exoplanet light-curve data. A correct assessment of correlated noise is fundamental to determine the true statistical signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings. Here, we review three of the most widely used correlated-noise estimators in the exoplanet ﬁeld, the time-averaging, residual-permutation, and wavelet-likelihood methods. We argue that the residual-permutation method is unsound in estimating the uncertainty of parameter estimates. We thus recommend to refrain from this method altogether. We characterize the behavior of the time averaging’s rms-versus-bin-size curves at bin sizes similar to the total observation duration, which may lead to underestimated uncertainties. For the wavelet-likelihood method, we note errors in the published equations and provide a list of corrections. We further assess the performance of these techniques by injecting and retrieving eclipse signals into synthetic and real Spitzer light curves, analyzing the results in terms of the relative-accuracy and coverage-fraction statistics. Both the time-averaging and waveletlikelihood methods signiﬁcantly improve the estimate of the eclipse depth over a white-noise analysis (a Markovchain Monte Carlo exploration assuming uncorrelated noise). However, the corrections are not perfect;when retrieving the eclipse depth from Spitzer data sets, these methods covered the true (injected) depth within the 68\% credible region in only ∼45\%–65\% of the trials. Lastly, we present our open-source model-ﬁtting tool, Multi-Core Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MC3). This package uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the best-ﬁtting values and the credible regions for the parameters for a (user-provided) model.

	abstract = {The surface of Mars has a high morphological and mineralogical diversity due to the intricacy of external, internal processes, and exchanges with the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the cryosphere. In particular, liquid water played an important role in surface evolution. However, the origin, duration and intensity of those wet events have been highly debated, especially in the clay-bearing geological units. Similarly, questions still remain about magma crystallization and volatile quantity of the dominant basaltic crust. In this work, six sites having hydrated minerals, salts and basaltic signatures (i.e., Mawrth Vallis, Holden crater, Eberswalde crater, Capri mensa, Eridania basin, Terra Sirenum) are investigated in order to better characterize the geological processes responsible for their formation and evolution (e.g., fluvial, lacustrine, in situ weathering, evaporitic, volcanic and aeolian processes). For that purpose, we use orbital multi-angular measurements from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on-board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft to analyze the manner in which light is scattered by the surface materials (photometry) in the near-infrared range (at 750nm). The surface bidirectional reflectance depends on the composition but also on the surface microtexture such as the grain size distribution, morphology, internal structure and surface roughness, tracers of the geological processes. The Hapke semi-analytical model of radiative transfer in granular medium is used to model the surface bidirectional reflectance estimated at 750nm from the orbital measurements after an atmospheric correction. The model depends on different radiative properties (e.g., single scattering albedo, grain phase function and regolith roughness) related to the surface composition and microtexture. In particular previous laboratory works showed that the particle phase function parameters, which describe the characteristics of the volume scattering, are sensitive to the grain morphology and internal structure. The surface material photometric parameters estimated from the CRISM multi-angular observations at 750nm are compared to the geological units in order to better characterize the geological processes. The photometric results show a high diversity of surface scattering behaviors (from a broad and backward scattering behavior to a narrow and forward scattering behavior) that suggests a high diversity of surface microtexture. A narrow forward scattering behavior has been detected for the first time from martian orbital data and observed in peculiar regions dominated by salt-bearing and clay-bearing materials. Hence the martian photometric results suggest that Mars experimented varied geological processes still preserved in the material microtexture. This study also demonstrates that these properties provide complementary information to mineralogy and geomorphology to better constrain the geological processes.},

	abstract = {In light of global remotely sensed data, the igneous crust of the Moon can no longer be viewed as a simple, globally stratified cumulus structure, composed of a flotation upper crust of anorthosite underlain by progressively more mafic rocks and a residual-melt (KREEP) sandwich horizon near the base of the lower crust. Instead, global geochemical information derived from Clementine multispectral data and Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data reveals at least three distinct provinces whose geochemistry and petrologic history make them geologically unique: (1) the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT), (2) the Feldspathic High-lands Terrane (FHT), and (3) the South Pole-Aitken Terrane (SPAT). The PKT is a mafic province, coincident with the largely resurfaced area in the Procellarum-Imbrium region whose petrogenesis relates to the early differentiation of the Moon. Here, some 40\% of the Th in the Moon's crust is concentrated into a region that constitutes only about 10\% of the crustal volume. This concentration of Th (average ∼5 ppm), and by implication the other heat producing elements, U and K, led to a fundamentally different thermal and igneous evolution within this region compared to other parts of the lunar crust. Lower-crustal materials within the PKT likely interacted with underlying mantle materials to produce hybrid magmatism, leading to the magnesian suite of lunar rocks and possibly KREEP basalt. Although rare in the Apollo sample collection, widespread mare volcanic rocks having substantial Th enrichment are indicated by the remote data and may reflect further interaction between enriched crustal residues and mantle sources. The FHT is characterized by a central anorthositic region that constitutes the remnant of an anorthositic craton resulting from early lunar differentiation. Basin impacts into this region do not excavate significantly more mafic material, suggesting a thickness of tens of kilometers of anorthositic crust. The feldspathic lunar meteorites may represent samples from the anorthositic central region of the FHT. Ejecta from deep-penetrating basin impacts outside of the central anorthositic region, however, indicate an increasingly mafic composition with depth. The SPAT, a mafic anomaly of great magnitude, may include material of the upper mantle as well as lower crust; thus it is designated a separate terrane. Whether the SPA basin impact simply uncovered lower crust such as we infer for the FHT remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {The intensity and polarization of light scattered by a variety of types of artificial particles large compared to the wavelength were measured as a function of phase angle. Shape, surface roughness, absorption coefficient, and internal scattering coefficient were varied systematically and their effects studied. Scattering by clear, smooth-surfaced spheres is in quantitative agreement with the predictions of the geometrical optics (ray theory) approximation to physical optics (Mie theory). However, almost any change from these ideal characteristics causes major departures from Mie theory. Hence, Mie theory is a poor predictor of the scattering properties of most large particles encountered in nature. An ideal sphere is strongly forward scattering, but irregularities redirect rays from the forward peak into smaller phase angles. This has the effect of decreasing the internal path length followed by an average ray as it traverses an absorbing dielectric particle, which increases the scattering efficiency. Internal scatterers can cause a particle to be back scattering. The phase functions of almost all of the particles measured have both forward and backward scattering lobes. Neither a first-order Legendre polynomial series nor a single Henyey-Greenstein function adequately describes the scattering functions of such particles. A two-parameter, double Henyey-Greenstein function generally provides reasonably good descriptions of the data, while keeping the number of free parameters to the minimum necessary. On a double Henyey-Greenstein parameter plot all of the particles fall into an L-shaped area of restricted size in which the location is characteristic of the particle type. Hence, this type of plot should be useful for estimating certain properties of a particle from its angular scattering function and vice versa. Formalisms based on the equivalent slab model are also given for estimating the scattering efficiency of a large, irregular particle. For most dielectric particles the transmitted, forward scattered light is partially negatively polarized. It is this component, and not the Brewster angle, that is responsible for the well-known maximum in the polarization curves of planetary regoliths at phase angles around 100°. For phase angles between about 30° and 70° the internally scattered light is found to be randomly polarized in the particles studied here, so that the only contribution to the second component of the Stokes vector is by Fresnel reflection from the particle surface. If this empirical result is general, measurement of the second Stokes vector of the light scattered from a regolith at these angles may provide a method of remotely measuring the mean refractive index.},

The derived six parameters (w,b,c,BS0,hS, and) for each tile were used to normalize the observed reflectance (standard angles i = g = 60°, e = 0° instead of the traditional angles i = g = 30°, e = 0°) within each tile, resulting in accurate normalization optimized for the local photometric response. Each pixel in the seven-color near-global mosaic (70°S to 70°N and 0°E to 360°E) was computed by the median of normalized reflectance from large numbers of repeated observations (UV: ∼50 and visible: ∼126 on average). The derived mosaic exhibits no significant artifacts with latitude or along the tile boundaries, demonstrating the quality of the normalization procedure. The derived Hapke parameter maps reveal regional photometric response variations across the lunar surface. The b, c (Henyey-Greenstein double-lobed phase function parameters) maps demonstrate decreased backscattering in the maria relative to the highlands (except 321 nm band), probably due to the higher content of both SMFe (submicron iron) and ilmenite in the interiors of back scattering agglutinates in the maria. The hS (angular width of shadow hiding opposition effect) map exhibits relatively lower values in the maria than the highlands and slightly higher values for immature highland crater ejecta, possibly related to the variation in a grain size distribution of regolith.},

A recent study proposed to estimate the uncertainties using a Bayesian approach (Schmidt et al., 2015). In the present article, we first propose an improved numerical implementation to speed up the uncertainties estimation. Then, we conduct two synthetic studies about photometric measurements in order to analyze the influence of observation geometry: First, we introduce the concept of “efficiency” of a set of geometries to sample the photometric behavior. A set of angular sampling elements (noted as geometry) is efficient if the retrieved Hapke parameters are close to the expected ones. We compared different geometries and found that the principal plane with high incidence is the most efficient geometry among the tested ones. In particular, such geometries are better than poorly sampled full BRDF. Second, we test the analysis scheme of a collection of photometric data acquired from various locations in order to answer the question: are these locations photometrically homogeneous or not? For instance, this question arises when combining data from an entire planetary body, where each spatial position is sampled at a single geometry. We tested the ability of the Bayesian method to decipher two situations, in the presence of noise: (i) a photometrically homogeneous surface (all observations with the same photometric behavior), or (ii) an heterogeneous surface with two distinct photometrical properties (half observations with photometric behavior 1, other half with photometric behavior 2). We show that the naive interpretation of the results provided by Bayesian method is not able to solve this problem. Therefore, we propose a separability test based on chi-square analysis, which is able to distinguish the two situations and thus, to access information about the photometric heterogeneity of a planetary body. When the noise level is high (10\%), our simulations show that separability cannot be solved.},

	abstract = {A series of natural granular surfaces composed of volcanic samples that widely vary in grain sizes (from the micron-scale to the millimeter-scale), shapes, surface aspects, origins, and including glass and minerals, has been measured in the visible domain with the spectro-imaging device ISEP (Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées, Toulouse, France) and inverted by photometric modeling. The experimental protocol makes use of a specific set of multiangular configurations (on the order of a few tens) with sufficient angular diversity and coverage of the bidirectional space to resolve differences in particle phase function behavior and surface texture. This restrained set delivers comparable results in terms of photometric parameters to those produced with a dense set of hundreds of measurements. The considered samples in this work have been chosen to assess the influence of varied physical properties on light scattering behavior. The following specific photometric trends are found. Samples comprising fresh glass or monocrystals in a proportion on the order of 30\% or more (from binocular magnifying glass inspection) are extremely forward scattering with narrow scattering lobes, and the larger the particles, the narrower the scattering lobe; also, round particles tend to be more backscattering than irregularly-shaped ones of similar texture, and the presence of voids within particles tends to increase the backscattering character of the sample. Particles with broad scattering lobes (phase function asymmetry parameter b⩽0.5) display relatively large modeled surface macroscopic roughness values (15–25°), while particles with narrow scattering lobes (b⩾0.5) show smaller modeled surface macroscopic roughness (between 15° and ∼3°). The comparison between the present results for the scattering parameters b and c, and those obtained in previous studies from artificial particles shows a similar trend and general agreement although some discrepancies were observed. The granular surface samples analyzed in the present study that contain a high proportion of isolated translucent monocrystals and/or fresh glass appear extremely forward-scattering and clearly chart a new part of the c vs. b trend. This is further supported by recent similar findings for martian in situ data and lunar regolith simulants. These results should help to better interpret present and future orbital and landed photometric data from bodies’ surfaces such as the Moon’s, Mars’, Vesta’s or Mercury’s regolith.},

	abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

	abstract = {Wavelet analysis is a rapidly developing area of mathematical and application-oriented research in many disciplines of science and engineering. The wavelet transform is a localized transform in both space (time) and frequency, and this property can be advantageously used to extract information from a signal that is not possible to unravel with a Fourier or even windowed Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms originated in geophysics in early 1980's for the analysis of seismic signal. After a decade of significant mathematical formalism they are now also being exploited for the analysis of several other geophysical processes such as atmospheric turbulence, space-time rainfall, ocean wind waves, seafloor bathymetry, geologic layered structures, climate change, among others. Due to their unique properties, well suited for the analysis of natural phenomena, it is anticipated that there will be an explosion of wavelet applications in geophysics in the next several years. This chapter provides a basic introduction to wavelet transforms and their most important properties. The theory and applications of wavelets is developing very rapidly and we see this chapter only as a limited basic introduction to wavelets which we hope to be of help to the unfamiliar reader and provide motivation and references for further study.},

	abstract = {The single particle phase function describes the manner in which an average element of a granular material diffuses the light in the angular space usually with two parameters: the asymmetry parameter b describing the width of the scattering lobe and the backscattering fraction c describing the main direction of the scattering lobe. Hapke proposed a convenient and widely used analytical model to describe the spectro-photometry of granular materials. Using a compilation of the published data, Hapke (Hapke, B. [2012]. Icarus 221, 1079–1083) recently studied the relationship of b and c for natural examples and proposed the hockey stick relation (excluding b{\textgreater}0.5 and c{\textgreater}0.5). For the moment, there is no theoretical explanation for this relationship. One goal of this article is to study a possible bias due to the retrieval method. We expand here an innovative Bayesian inversion method in order to study into detail the uncertainties of retrieved parameters. On Emission Phase Function (EPF) data, we demonstrate that the uncertainties of the retrieved parameters follow the same hockey stick relation, suggesting that this relation is due to the fact that b and c are coupled parameters in the Hapke model instead of a natural phenomena. Nevertheless, the data used in the Hapke (Hapke, B. [2012]. Icarus 221, 1079–1083) compilation generally are full Bidirectional Reflectance Diffusion Function (BRDF) that are shown not to be subject to this artifact. Moreover, the Bayesian method is a good tool to test if the sampling geometry is sufficient to constrain the parameters (single scattering albedo, surface roughness, b,c, opposition effect). We performed sensitivity tests by mimicking various surface scattering properties and various single image-like/disk resolved image, EPF-like and BRDF-like geometric sampling conditions. The second goal of this article is to estimate the favorable geometric conditions for an accurate estimation of photometric parameters in order to provide new constraints for future observation campaigns and instrumentations.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic formulation of inverse problems leads to the definition of a probability distribution in the model space. This probability distribution combines a priori information with new information obtained by measuring some observable parameters (data). As, in the general case, the theory linking data with model parameters is nonlinear, the a posteriori probability in the model space may not be easy to describe (it may be multimodal, some moments may not be defined, etc.). When analysing an inverse problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model is usually not sufficient, as we normally also wish to have information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case we may have a large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyse and display the models in such a way that information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available. The most well known importance sampling method, the Metropolis algorithm, can be generalized, and this gives a method that allows analysis of (possibly highly nonlinear) inverse problems with complex a priori information and data with an arbitrary noise distribution.},

	abstract = {We present a phenomenological model of intermittency called the β-model and related to the Novikov-Stewart (1964) model. The key assumption is that in scales ∼ l02−n only a fraction βn of the total space has an appreciable excitation. The model, the idea of which owes much to Kraichnan (1972, 1974), is dynamical in the sense that we work entirely with inertial-range quantities such as velocity amplitudes, eddy turn-over times and energy transfer. This gives more physical insight than the traditional approach based on probabilistic models of the dissipation.The β-model leads in an elementary way to the concept of the self-similarity dimension D, a special case of Mandelbrot's (1974, 1976) ‘fractal dimension’. For three-dimensional turbulence, the correction B to the 5353{\textbackslash}frac\{5\}\{3\} exponent of the energy spectrum is equal to 13(3−D)13(3−D){\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}(3 - D) and is related to the exponent μ of the dissipation correlation function by B=13μB=13μB = {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mu  (0.17 for the currently accepted value). This is a borderline case of the Mandelbrot inequality B⩽13μB⩽13μB {\textbackslash}leqslant {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{3\}{\textbackslash}mu . It is shown in the appendix that this inequality may be derived from the Navier-Stokes equation under the strong, but plausible, assumption that the inertial-range scaling laws for second- and fourth-order moments have the same viscous cut-off.The predictions of the β-model for the spectrum and for higher-order statistics are in agreement with recent conjectures based on analogies with critical phenomena (Nelkin 1975) but generally diasgree with the 1962 Kolmogorov lognormal model. However, the sixth-order structure function 〈δv6(l)〉 and the dissipation correlation function 〈ε(r)ε(r + 1)〉 are related by⟨δv6(l)⟩/l2∼⟨ϵ(r)ϵ(r+l)⟩⟨δv6(l)⟩/l2∼⟨ϵ(r)ϵ(r+l)⟩{\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}delta v{\textasciicircum}6(l){\textbackslash}rangle /l{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}epsilon(\{{\textbackslash}bf r\}){\textbackslash}epsilon(\{{\textbackslash}bf r\}+\{{\textbackslash}bf l\}){\textbackslash}ranglein both models. We conjecture that this relation is model independent.Finally, some possible directions for further numerical and experimental work on intermittency are indicated.},
